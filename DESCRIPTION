Title: Import, Model, and Plot Cell Sinking Data
Author: Melissa Rioux <mlrioux@mta.ca>
Maintainer: Melissa Rioux <mlrioux@mta.ca>
Description:
    This package handles the import, modelling, and plotting of phytoplankton cell sinking data.
    The data should be generated according to the sinking assay protocol created by the Campbell lab at Mount Allison University 
    (see Bannon and Campbell, 2017). 
    These functions allow the user to import cell sinking data from certain plate spectrophotometers, generate plots of fluorescence
    versus time by well, fit segmented regressions by well, and generate sinking rate estimates.
